# This file can be used to explicitly map a release to a specific table-of-contents
# (TOC). You'll want to use this after any revamps to information architecture, to ensure
# that the navigation for older versions still work.
#
# Below is a commented out example of what this may look like:

master: master-toc
v0.16.0: v0-16-0toc
v0.15.4: v0-15-4toc
v0.15.3: v0-15-3toc
v0.15.2: v0-15-2toc
v0.15.1: v0-15-1toc
