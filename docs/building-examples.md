# Examples

## Quickstart

The quickstart example is built with [ksonnet][0].

The JSON files are generated with the `make generate-examples` command. To get this to work you must have ksonnet-lib installed in `/usr/local/lib/jsonnet/ksonnet-lib`. After that, `make generate-examples` will build the JSON files that are checked into this repository.
